		<h1>Understanding ISO - A Beginner's Guide</h1>

        <p>It is challenging to take good pictures without a good understanding of how ISO works and what it does. 				Camera ISO is one of the three pillars of photography (the other two being Aperture and Shutter Speed) and every photographer should thoroughly understand it, to get the most out of their equipment. Since this article is for beginners in photography, I will try to explain ISO as simple as I can.</p>
         	<h3>1) What is ISO?</h3>
				<p>In very basic terms, ISO is the level of sensitivity of your camera to available light. The lower the ISO number, the less sensitive it is to the light, while a higher ISO number increases the sensitivity of your camera. The component within your camera that can change sensitivity is called “image sensor” or simply “sensor”. It is the most important (and most expensive) part of a camera and it is responsible for gathering light and transforming it into an image. With increased sensitivity, your camera sensor can capture images in low-light environments without having to use a flash. But higher sensitivity comes at an expense – it adds grain or “noise” to the pictures.</p>

            </figurecaption>

<p>
Typically, ISO numbers start from 100-200 (Base ISO) and increment in value in geometric progression (power of two). So, the ISO sequence is: 100, 200, 400, 800, 1600, 3200, 6400 and etc. The important thing to understand, is that each step between the numbers effectively doubles the sensitivity of the sensor. So, ISO 200 is twice more sensitive than ISO 100, while ISO 400 is twice more sensitive than ISO 200. This makes ISO 400 four times more sensitive to light than ISO 100, and ISO 1600 sixteen times more sensitive to light than ISO 100, so on and so forth. What does it mean when a sensor is sixteen times more sensitive to light? It means that it needs sixteen times less time to capture an image!</p>
		<h3>2) When to use low ISO?</h3>
			<p>As I’ve said above, you should always try to stick to the lowest ISO (base ISO) of your camera, which is typically ISO 100 or 200, whenever possible. When there is plenty of light, you should always use the lowest ISO, to retain the most detail and to have the highest image quality. There are some cases where you might want to use low ISO in dim or dark environments – for example, if you have your camera mounted on a tripod or sitting on a flat surface. In that case, bear in mind that your camera will most likely need more time to capture the scene and anything that is moving is probably going to look like a ghost.</p>

		<h4>ISO</h4>
   	 
     		<ul>
     			<li><strong>100</strong> Full sun, no shade</li>
       			<li><strong>200</strong> Lost of sun, could be in apartial shade or an overcast day out in the open</li>
        		<li><strong>200</strong> Inside on a sunny day, directly by a large window</li>
       		 	<li><strong>400</strong>In the shade on a sunny day or under a covered area on an overcast day</li>
        		<li><strong>700</strong>Inside on a sunny or overcast day(near a window)</li>
        		<li><strong>800</strong>inside, quite a distance from a window</li>
        		<li><strong>1250</strong>Inside during the evening, light bulbs are the only source of light</li>
        		<li><strong>1600</strong>Inside a dark room where there is a light source(theatre, school, production,etc)</li>
    		</ul>
     </div>
	</figure>

<h3>3) When to increase ISO?</h3>
<p>You should increase the ISO when there is not enough light for the camera to be able to quickly capture an image. Anytime I shoot indoors without a flash, I set my ISO to a higher number to be able to capture the moment without introducing blur to the image. Other cases where you might want to increase ISO are when you need to get ultra-fast shots, like the bird picture I posted above. But before increasing the ISO, you should think if it is OK for you to introduce noise to the image.</p>
<p>On many of the newer DSLRs, there is a setting for “Auto ISO”, which works great in low-light environments. The beauty of this setting, is that you can set the maximum ISO to a certain number, so when the ISO is automatically increased based on the amount of light, it does not cross the set barrier. So, if I want to limit the amount of grain in my pictures, I typically set the maximum ISO to 800.</p>
